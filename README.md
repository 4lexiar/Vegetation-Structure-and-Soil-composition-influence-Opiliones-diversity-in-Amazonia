Ecological synthesis on harvestmen diversity across spatial scales â€“ based on 2014 data.

## About this project

This is my undergraduate thesis and also my first scientific article. The data were collected in 2014, and ten years later I developed this ecological synthesis to explore how the diversity of harvestmen (arachnids) is influenced by different factors depending on the spatial scale considered.
